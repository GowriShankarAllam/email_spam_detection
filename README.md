# 📧 Email Spam Detection Using Machine Learning

Email spam detection plays a vital role in cybersecurity, acting as a shield to protect users' inboxes from unauthorized or malicious content. This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques—including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks—to identify and classify emails as spam or legitimate (ham). It efficiently analyzes email content, sender data, and metadata to reduce the risk of phishing, scams, and other fraudulent activities.

## 🎯 Features

- ✅ **Automated Spam Classification** using multiple ML algorithms.
- 🧹 **Data Preprocessing** to clean, normalize, and vectorize email data.
- ♻️ **Model Training & Retraining** based on updated spam patterns.
- 🔄 **Real-time Detection** to classify emails instantly.
- 📊 **Evaluation Metrics** including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC-AUC.
- 🧠 **Algorithm Support** for Naive Bayes, SVM, and Neural Networks.
- 🌐 **Scalable Architecture** for various deployment scenarios.
- 🔧 **Customizable Configuration** for tuning model and preprocessing pipelines.
